# 👔 SCyWF (Saudi Cybersecurity Workforce Framework) - The "Job Description" Guide

> **"A 'Cyber Ninja' is not a job title. Please stop."**

Welcome to the **SCyWF**. This is for HR, Hiring Managers, and anyone trying to figure out what a "SOC Analyst" actually does.

---

## 🗂️ The Structure (It's a Hierarchy)
1.  **Categories**: Broad fields (e.g., Protection & Defense).
2.  **Specialty Areas**: Specific domains (e.g., Incident Response).
3.  **Job Roles**: The actual job (e.g., `PD-IR-001`: Incident Responder).

---

## 🛑 How to Use This (For HR)
*   **Don't Invent Titles**: Instead of "Data Wizard", use "Cybersecurity Data Science Specialist" (`CARD-CRD-005`).
*   **Standardize Requirements**: If you are hiring a **Penetration Tester** (`PD-VA-002`), the framework lists exactly what they need to know (e.g., Knowledge of network protocols, Skill in using Metasploit, Ability to think like an attacker).
*   **Career Paths**: Show your employees how to move from "System Security Analyst" to "CISO".

---

## 🔍 Key Roles (The Usual Suspects)
### 1. The CISO (`LWD-L-001`)
*   **Job**: The Boss. Sets strategy, takes the heat when things go wrong.
*   **Needs**: Leadership, Business Acumen, and deep technical understanding.

### 2. The SOC Analyst (`PD-D-001`)
*   **Job**: The Watcher. Stares at screens, detects threats.
*   **Needs**: Log analysis, SIEM knowledge, patience.

### 3. The Pentester (`PD-VA-002`)
*   **Job**: The Hacker. Breaks things (legally) to find holes.
*   **Needs**: Scripting, OS internals, creative thinking.

### 4. The GRC Specialist (`GRCL-GRC-002`)
*   **Job**: The Auditor. Ensures compliance (checks the boxes).
*   **Needs**: Knowledge of ECC, ISO 27001, and persistence.

## 📋 The "Hiring" Checklist
- [ ] **Map Roles**: Go through your current org chart. Does "Bob from IT" align with `PD-D-003`?
- [ ] **Update JDs**: Rewrite your job descriptions using SCyWF terminology.
- [ ] **Training**: If Bob wants to be a Pentester, look at the KSAs for `PD-VA-002` and send him to training that covers those gaps.
