# 🏢 RFMSOC (Regulatory Framework for Licensing MSOC Services) - The "So You Want to Be an MSSP?" Guide

> **"If you want to sell security, you better be secure."**

Welcome to the **RFMSOC**. This isn't for the average company. This is for the **Service Providers** who want to operate a Managed SOC (MSOC) in the Kingdom.

## 🎟️ The Ticket to Ride (Licensing)
You cannot just open a SOC and start selling services. You need a license from the NCA.
There are two tiers:

### Tier 1 (The Big League)
*   **Scope**: Can serve Critical National Infrastructure (CNI).
*   **Fees**: expensive (50k SAR to apply).
*   **Staffing**: Requires a LOT of analysts (e.g., if you have 91+ clients, you need 81 full-time analysts!).

### Tier 2 (The Mid Market)
*   **Scope**: Cannot serve CNI (mostly).
*   **Fees**: Cheaper (15k SAR).
*   **Staffing**: Lower requirements (e.g., 9-19 analysts).

## 👮 Staffing Requirements (Brains over Bots)
You can't just run scripts. You need qualified humans.
*   **Categories**:
    *   **Category A**: Senior/Lead Analysts.
    *   **Category B**: Mid-level.
    *   **Category C**: Juniors.
*   **Saudization**: Technical roles must be filled by qualified Saudi nationals (verify the exact % in the latest regulation, but assume it's high).

## 📝 The Process
1.  **Pay the Fee**: Money talks.
2.  **Audit**: The NCA will inspect your SOC. They will look at your physical security, your technology stack, and your people.
3.  **Get the License**: Do not operate without it.

## 📋 The "Provider" Checklist
- [ ] **Physical Operations Center**: Do you have a secure room with screens? (Yes, you actually need one).
- [ ] **Data Residency**: Customer logs generally must stay in KSA.
- [ ] **SLA**: You need defined Service Level Agreements. "We'll get back to you eventually" is not an SLA.
- [ ] **Staffing Plan**: Hire your analysts *before* you apply.

*Disclaimer: Operating an unauthorized SOC for CNI entities is a good way to get shut down efficiently.*
