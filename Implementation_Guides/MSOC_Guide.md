# 🚨 MSOC (Managed Security Operations Center) - The "Rent-a-Guard" Guide

> **"You wouldn't hire an unlicensed doctor. Don't hire an unlicensed SOC."**

Welcome to the **MSOC Policy**. This defines the rules for *hiring* someone to watch your network.

---

## 🙋 Who needs this?
If you are an organization (especially Critical Infrastructure) and you don't want to build your own SOC (because it costs millions), you will hire a **Managed SOC (MSOC)**.

---

## 📜 The Golden Rule
**You MUST hire a Licensed Service Provider.**
The NCA maintains a list of licensed MSOC providers.
*   **Tier 1 License**: Required for Critical National Infrastructure (CNI).
*   **Tier 2 License**: Okay for non-critical entities.

*If you hire "Ahmed's PC Repair & SOC" and they don't have a license, you are non-compliant.*

---

## 🤝 Your Obligations (As the Client)
1.  **Verify the License**: Ask to see their NCA certificate. Check the expiration date.
2.  **Define the Scope**: What are they monitoring? Your servers? Cloud? OT?
3.  **Data Sovereignty**: Ensure they are keeping your logs inside the Kingdom.
    *   *Question*: "Can you store my logs in a cloud in Europe?"
    *   *Answer*: "No."

---

## 🏗️ What to look for in a Provider
*   **SLA (Service Level Agreement)**: How fast will they call you if you get hacked? 15 minutes? 1 hour? Next Tuesday?
*   **Integration**: Can they see your OT network? (If you have one).
*   **Reporting**: You need weekly/monthly reports to show your boss (and the NCA auditors) that you are being watched.

## 📋 The "Shopping" Checklist
- [ ] **Check License**: Go to the NCA website and verify the vendor.
- [ ] **Tier Check**: Are you CNI? If yes, you need a Tier 1 vendor.
- [ ] **Contract Review**: Does the contract explicitly mention "NCA Compliance"?
- [ ] **Incident Response**: When they find a hack, do they just email you, or do they help you fix it?

*Disclaimer: Outsourcing your SOC does not outsource your risk. You are still responsible if you get breached. Choose wisely.*
