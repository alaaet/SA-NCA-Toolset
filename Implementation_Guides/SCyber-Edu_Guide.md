# 🎓 SCyber-Edu (Saudi Cybersecurity Higher Education Framework) - The "Syllabus" Guide

> **"Those who can, do. Those who can do more, teach."**

Welcome to **SCyber-Edu**. This is the mandatory playbook for any University in KSA that wants to offer a degree in Cybersecurity. You can't just teach "Introduction to Computers" and call it a Cyber degree anymore.

## 🏛️ The Programs
The framework defines minimum requirements for:
*   **Diploma**: 2 years.
*   **Bachelor**: 4 years (Major or Track).
*   **Higher Diploma**: 1 year post-grad.
*   **Master**: 2 years.
*   **Doctoral**: PhD.

## 📚 The Knowledge Units (KUs)
You must teach specific "Knowledge Units". A course (e.g., "Network Security 101") can cover multiple KUs.
### Core KUs (The Must-Haves)
1.  **CSF (Cybersecurity Foundations)**: The basics. CIA triad, risk, ethics.
2.  **BCY (Basic Cryptography)**: Symmetric vs Asymmetric. Hashing. (Don't teach them to write their own crypto).
3.  **NDF (Network Defense)**: Firewalls, IDS/IPS, VPNs.
4.  **CTH (Cyber Threats)**: Malware, Phishing, APTs.
5.  **PLE (Policy, Legal, Ethics)**: The Saudi Anti-Cyber Crime Law.

## 🏗️ Building a Curriculum
*   **Bachelor Degree**: Must cover all Core KUs + Electives + Math.
*   **Math Requirements**: Yes, you need math. Discrete Math, Statistics, and maybe Calculus (sorry students).
*   **Practical Labs**: Theory is not enough. You need hands-on labs (Virtual Machines, Cyber Ranges).

## 📋 The "Dean's" Checklist
- [ ] **Audit Courses**: Do your current courses map to the SCyber-Edu KUs?
- [ ] **Lab Access**: Do students have a safe place to launch malware? (Sandbox).
- [ ] **Faculty**: Do your professors actually know cybersecurity, or are they just reading slides? (See SCyWF for hiring).
- [ ] **Accreditation**: Align with NCA and ETEC/NCAAA requirements.

*Disclaimer: Teaching students how to hack is easy. Teaching them how to hack ethically is the hard part.*
