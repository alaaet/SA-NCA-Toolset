# 🛒 CGEC (Cybersecurity Guidelines for E-commerce Consumers) - The "Online Shopping" Guide

> **"If it sounds too good to be true, it's probably a phishing site."**

Welcome to the **CGEC**. This isn't for the IT Manager. This is for **You**, the consumer, trying to buy things online without emptying your bank account into a hacker's wallet.

## 🛑 The "Red Flags" (Do Not Buy If...)
1.  **No HTTPS**: Look at the URL bar. If you don't see the padlock 🔒 or "https://", run away. Your credit card number will travel naked across the internet.
2.  **Unrealistic Prices**: An iPhone 15 for 500 SAR? That's a scam.
3.  **Weird URLs**: `www.amazon-saudi-special-offers.com` is NOT Amazon.
4.  **Bad Grammar**: "Dear Customer, kindly update card for receive package."

## 💳 Payment Safety (Keep Your Money)
*   **Use a Dedicated Card**: Use a low-limit prepaid card for online shopping. If it gets hacked, they steal 500 SAR, not your life savings.
*   **Enable SMS Alerts**: You should know the second money leaves your account.
*   **eWallets**: Apple Pay and mada Pay are safer than typing your card number directly. They tokenize your data.

## 🔐 Account Hygiene
*   **Unique Passwords**: Don't use the same password for Souq/Amazon that you use for your email.
*   **MFA**: If the store offers "Text me a code", enable it.
*   **Guest Checkout**: If you can, check out as a guest. Don't store your card on every random website.

## 📋 The "Checkout" Checklist
- [ ] **Verify**: Is this a known store? Check existing reviews (e.g., Ma'aroof).
- [ ] **Secure**: Is my connection secure? (Don't shop on Airport Wi-Fi!).
- [ ] **Limit**: Did I just give them my Mother's Maiden Name? (Why do they need that to ship a t-shirt?). Don't overshare.
- [ ] **Update**: Is my browser/app updated?
