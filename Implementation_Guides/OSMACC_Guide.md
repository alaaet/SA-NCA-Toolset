# 📱 OSMACC (Organizations’ Social Media Accounts Cybersecurity Controls) - The "Don't Get Cancelled" Guide

> **"It takes 20 years to build a reputation and 5 minutes to ruin it."**

Welcome to the **OSMACC**. This isn't about getting likes; it's about making sure your official Twitter account doesn't start posting crypto scams or declaring war on a neighboring country.

## 🎯 The Target
This applies to your **Official** accounts: X (Twitter), LinkedIn, Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube, etc.

## 🛑 The "Influencer" Rules

### 1. Identity Hygiene
*   **Official Emails Only**: Never register an official account with `cool_guy_123@gmail.com`. Use `social@ministry.gov.sa`.
*   **Shared Passwords**: Stop texting the password to the intern. Use a Password Manager with shared vaults.
*   **MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)**: Enable it. Everywhere. SMS is okay; App-based (Authenticator) is better. Security Keys (YubiKey) are best.

### 2. Device Security
*   **The "Tweeting Phone"**: The device used to post official content must be managed (MDM). It should pass the TCC requirements.
*   **No Personal Use**: Do not use the official phone to play Candy Crush or browse questionable sites.

### 3. Impersonation (The Clone Wars)
*   **Verification**: Get that Blue Checkmark. It helps.
*   **Monitor**: actively search for fake accounts pretending to be you. Report them immediately.

### 4. Crisis Management
*   **The "Account Takeover" Drill**: What do you do if you wake up and your logo has been replaced with a doge meme?
    *   Have a contact at the platform (if possible).
    *   Have a "Kill Switch" procedure to lock accounts.

## 📋 The "Viral" Checklist
- [ ] **Inventory**: List all your accounts. Even the one on Google+ (RIP).
- [ ] **Access Audit**: Who has access? Did Ahmed leave the company last month? Remove him!!
- [ ] **MFA Check**: Go to Settings > Security on every platform and ensure MFA is ON.
- [ ] **Content Approval**: Do not let one person post without a second pair of eyes (Four-Eyes Principle), at least for major announcements.

*Disclaimer: A hacked social media account is a PR nightmare involving screenshots that live forever. Secure it.*
