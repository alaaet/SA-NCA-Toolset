Purpose

This document aims to establish the <cybersecurity function> in
<organization name> that is independent from the <information technology
function>, as per the Royal Decree No. 37140 dated 14/08/1438H and other
relevant legislative and regulatory requirements. This goal is a regulatory
requirement as per the controls issued by the National Cybersecurity Authority
(NCA) and other relevant legislative and regulatory requirements.

The cybersecurity organizational structure was developed based on best
practices and standards to provide the <cybersecurity function> with the needed
support to carry out its delegated tasks as required. The <cybersecurity
function> is one of the key pillars of <organization name>, and it is responsible
for the protection of information and technology assets against cyber risks.

This document aims to define and document the organizational structure
of cybersecurity governance, roles and responsibilities within <organization
name> .

Guidelines
1- Ensure that the <cybersecurity function> is independent from the

<information technology function>.

2- Ensure that the <cybersecurity function> reports to the head of the
organization or his/her delegate in <organization name>, having the power
to influence key cybersecurity decisions within <organization name>.

3- Ensure that such reporting relationship of the <cybersecurity function>
differs from that of the <information technology function> or <digital
transformation function>, as per the Royal Decree No. 37140 dated
14/08/1438H, which is a regulatory requirement under Control No. 1-2-1 in
the Essential Cybersecurity Controls (ECC–1:2018).

4- Avoid conflicts of interests, among which:

4-1 Managing technology and information system access (or operational

systems) validity and their operations at the same time.

4-2 Implementing cybersecurity requirements and ensuring compliance

with them at the same time.

application development team.

5- Ensure that the cybersecurity organizational structure includes the following

roles as a minimum:
5-1 Cybersecurity governance.
5-2 Cybersecurity compliance management.
5-3 Cybersecurity risk management.
5-4 Cybersecurity strategy management.
5-5 Cybersecurity resilience.
5-6 Cybersecurity training and awareness.
5-7 Cybersecurity operations (Cybersecurity monitoring and incident

response).

5-8 Data and information protection.
5-9 Cybersecurity related to operational systems and industrial control

systems (OT/ICS) (if applicable)

6- The following roles might be added to the cybersecurity organizational

structure:
