advancements, IT infrastructure and organizational changes, and shifts in
organizational mission and priorities. Continuous improvement is essential to
the success of the cybersecurity awareness program.

1. Evaluation and Feedback

Formal evaluation and feedback mechanisms are critical components of any
security awareness, training, and education program. Continuous improvement
cannot occur without a good sense of how the existing program is working. In
addition, the feedback mechanism must be designed to address objectives
initially established for the program.

An evaluation assessment needs to be carried out, to identify the
cybersecurity awareness and training related maturity level of <organization
name>. For this purpose, <organization name> might use the example
Cybersecurity Awareness Assessment Questionnaire (Annex A of this
document).

A feedback strategy needs to incorporate elements that will address:

● Quality
● Scope
● Deployment method (e.g., web-based, onsite, offsite)
● Level of difficulty
● Ease of use, duration of session
● Relevancy
● Suggestions for modification

<organization name> must also do periodic testing to validate the
effectiveness of the cybersecurity awareness program (i.e. simulated attacks,
phishing campaign, etc.)

2. Program Success Factors

It is critical that everyone is capable and willing to carry out their assigned
cybersecurity roles in <organization name>. Listed below are some key
indicators to gauge the support for, and acceptance of, the program.
