2-3 Risk Response:

2-3-1 The <organization name> must select the risk response

decision based on the following:

applying the necessary security controls to reduce the
likelihood or impact or both, which help control risks and
bring them to a level that could be accepted. The
organization must do the following:
Identifying, documenting and prioritizing risk
response plans to deal with current risks.

• Executing risk response plans based on priority.

• Calculating residual risks after conducting risk

response plans.

2-3-1-2 Risk Avoidance: Remove risk by avoiding

the

conditions that create it.

2-3-1-2-1 Risk Transfer: Pass the risk to a third party
that has better capabilities to deal with it or
insure information and technology assets
