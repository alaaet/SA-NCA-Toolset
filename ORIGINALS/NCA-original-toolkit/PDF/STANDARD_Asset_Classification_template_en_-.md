Asset Classification Standard Template

Purpose

 This standard aims to define the detailed cybersecurity requirements
related to the asset classification of <organization name>'s systems, data and
information to minimize cybersecurity risks resulting from internal and external
threats at <organization's name> in order to preserve confidentiality, integrity
and availability.

The requirements in this standard are aligned with the cybersecurity
requirements issued by the National Cybersecurity Authority (NCA) in addition
to other related cybersecurity legal and regulatory requirements.

Scope

This standard covers all assets (e.g., physical, data, business application,
software and technology assets) in the <organization name> and applies to all
personnel (employees and contractors) in the <organization name>.

by using improper protective measures, controls or handling
critical assets incorrectly which may lead to exposure or
breach.

All assets owned and managed by <organization name> must
be classified.

Physical assets (e.g., network connection devices, IDS/IPS,
storage assets and critical systems’ peripherals) must be

Business application and software assets must be classified
by reference to the highest classification of the information
input, processed, stored, transmitted or deleted by users of
the application or software.

Third party and suppliers must be classified by reference to
the highest classification of the information input, processed,
stored, transmitted or deleted by the third party or supplier.

Any asset (information, physical, business application,
software and third party and supplier) that inputs, processes,
stores,
transmits or deletes personal and/or sensitive
information must be classified as “Critical”, “High”, “Moderate”,
“Low” in addition to any other classification required.

Unlabeled assets can be difficult to track, monitor or return to

included in an asset register, which can lead to the asset not
being updated or maintained in the appropriate manner.
Unlabeled physical assets may be handled incorrectly, which
may result in damage, theft or loss.

All physical assets owned by the organization must have a
tamper-proof label attached.

The tamper proof label must show the unique identifier
assigned to the asset in the asset register as a number, bar
code or QR code.

Physical asset handling

Objective

To protect assets by handling them in a secure manner.

Improper or careless handling of physical assets can lead to
damage, loss or theft of the asset and any information stored
or accessible on the device. Depending on the asset and
information, <organization name> may be exposed to legal or
regulatory investigations and penalties.

Approval must be obtained from the asset owner if a physical
asset is to be removed from its designated location.

Storage media, such as hard disk drives, that has been used
to store classified information classified as “Top Secret”,
“Secret”, “Confidential” must be securely erased using a
published erasure method such that data cannot be retrieved
(e.g., NIST SP800-88 Rev.1).

Storage, such as hard disk drives, that has been used to store
classified information classified as classified information
classified as “Top Secret”, “Secret”, “Confidential” must be
physically destroyed (e.g. by shredding to Deutsches Institut
für Normung (DIN) 66399 standard as O-5 and H-5 or
incineration).

users must acknowledge they have received and completed
the training.

using a published erasure method such that data cannot be
retrieved following decommissioning (e.g. NIST SP800-88
Rev.1).

Storage, such as hard disk drives, in mobile devices that have
been used to store classified information classified as “Top
Secret”, “Secret”, “Confidential” must be physically destroyed
following decommissioning (e.g., by shredding to DIN 66399
standard O-5 and H-5 or incineration).

Portable storage devices that have been used to store
classified information must be physically destroyed following
decommissioning (e.g., by shredding to DIN 66399 standard
O-5 and H-5 or incineration).
