2. **Network Access Controls**
 1. Develop and approve procedures ‏must be used to grant and deny ‏access to ‏ <organization name> networks ‏‏, ‏according to ‏ ‏<organization name>'s ‏ Identity and Access Management Policy‏.
 2. Access to network must be granted based on a request submitted by user to the <information technology function> indicating the type, duration and reasons of request.

 4. Username and password must be used to access ‏<organization name>’s network according ‏to ‏ ‏<organization name> approved ‏ Identity and Access Management Policy.
 5. Provide technologies necessary must be used to restrict and manage access to network services, protocols and ports.
 6. Restrict all physical data ports must be within <organization name>’s ‏ ‏facilities by port security or port-based authentication in order to reduce the exposure of network and possibly have unauthorized devices connect while being undetected.
 7. Restrict and open network ports, protocols, and services must be used for remote access operations, especially on internal and critical systems as needed.
3. **Third Parties Access Controls to the Network**
 1. Granting access to the <organization name> network to third parties must be subject to cybersecurity requirements mentioned in the third party’s cybersecurity policy approved by <organization name>.
 2. Secure encryption and authentication mechanisms must be used to transfer data to and from third parties.
 3. A specified duration must be granted to third parties to access <organization name>’s network as agreed with the system owner.
 4. User and third parties access rights must be regularly reviewed according to <organization name>’s cybersecurity policies.
 5. Remote Access Management and Authentication (RAM) must be prevented on devices located in the organization's External-Facing Host.
 6. Third-party personnel must be prevented from connecting to the network or WI-FI of <organization name> without ‏ ‏vulnerabilities ‏ ‏check ‏ ‏in addition to ‏ ‏updating the antivirus program, making the proper configuration and ensuring that their activities can be monitored.
4. **Network Protection**
 1. Segment and segregate networks must be physically and logically using firewall and defence-in-depth mechanisms.
 2. Segment critical systems network (VLAN) must be physically and logically.
 3. Segregate production environment networks must be ‏logically from testing environment network and other networks.
 4. Monitor internal and external networks must be used for suspected activities.
 5. Prevent connecting critical systems to the internet must be used if they are providing internal service to <organization name> and there is no need for remote access.
 6. Segregate must be used for Voice Over IP "VOIP" network logically from data network.
 7. Appropriate technologies must be used to secure browsing and internet connectivity through restricting use of suspicious websites., file storage/sharing and remote access websites.
 8. Approve periodic update packages and security patches of assets in the production environment must be by the manufacturer and test them in a sandbox environment before being applied to the production environment.
 9. Protection ‏ ‏mechanisms must be securely implemented, managed and regularly updated to protect the internet browsing channel against Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) ‏that contains usually viruses ‏ ‏and zero-day malware ‏‏.
 10. Prevent connecting internal ‏ ‏network directly to the internet. Connection must be via proxy to analyse and filter data ‏ ‏from and to <organization name> ‏‏.
