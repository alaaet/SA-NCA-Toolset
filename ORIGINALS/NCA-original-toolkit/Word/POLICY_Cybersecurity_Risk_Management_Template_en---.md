This policy covers all information and technology assets and systems in the <organization name> in addition to its work procedures in <organization name> and applies to all personnel (employees and contractors) in the <organization name>.

[Policy](#_heading=h.2et92p0) Statements

1. **General Requirements**
 1. Cybersecurity ‏Risk ‏Management Methodology and cybersecurity risk management procedures in ‏<organization name> must be defined, documented and approved, ‏while ensuring ‏its alignment with the ‏National Cybersecurity Risk Management Framework, which has already been aligned with internationally approved standards and ‏guidelines ‏(e.g. ISO27005, ISO31000, NIST).
 2. The Cybersecurity Risk Management Methodology must serve the following purposes:
 1. Define, collect, and list assets, then classify and prioritize them based on the level of protection required.
 2. Define and evaluate risks to the business, assets, or personnel ‏of ‏<organization name> ‏ (e.g. cybersecurity risks on ‏<organization name>).
 3. Evaluate cybersecurity risks in planning and before approving use of social media as well as telework for any service or system.
 4. Define and evaluate information and technology assets vulnerability to specific threats.
 5. Define decisions to respond to such risks.
 6. Prioritize risk response plans based on specific procedures.
 7. ‏Classify and define risk levels based on the risk probability ‏and impact on <organization name>.
 8. Define the roles and responsibilities to manage and deal with cybersecurity risk.
 3. A periodic risk assessment ‏must be conducted to ensure ‏security of information and technology assets and prioritization of risk levels.
 4. ‏Cybersecurity risks must be managed in a methodological approach to protect information and technology assets in <organization name>.
 5. ‏Cybersecurity risks in <organization name> must be managed and overseen on a continuous basis. ‏
 6. Cybersecurity Risk Management must be aligned with the Enterprise Risk Management “ERM” in ‏ ‏<organization name>. ‏
 7. Risk management related recommendations, issued by NCA, must be applied.
 8. Key performance indicators (KPI) must be used to ensure the continuous improvement and effective and efficient use of Cybersecurity Risk Management requirements.
2. **Main Stages for Cybersecurity Risks Management**
 1. **Risk Identification**:

This process must cover the following:

* + 1. Assets must be identified and an inventory list must be prepared with prioritized list and classifications.
 2. Potential vulnerabilities and threats on assets must be identified.
 3. Current risks on assets must be identified through:
 1. Developing potential risks scenarios as per the identified vulnerabilities, threats and attacks.
 2. Identifying currently applied cybersecurity controls to counter identified risks. ‏
 1. **Risk Assessment:**
 1. The <cybersecurity function> ‏must ‏implement ‏cybersecurity risk assessment procedures as a minimum in the following cases:
 1. ‏Every 3 years at least for all information and technology assets, and at least once a year for critical systems, telework systems, and social media accounts.
 2. At early stages of technology projects.
 3. Before making major changes to infrastructure.
 4. When planning to acquire new services from a third party.
 5. At the planning stage and before the launch of new technology products and services.
 2. Risks must be re-assessed and updated as follows:
 1. After a cybersecurity incident that compromises information and technology asset integrity, availability, or confidentiality.
 2. After a significant audit findings or proactive data.
 3. Whenever information and technology assets experience significant enhancement or modification.
 3. Current risks assessment process must cover the following:
 1. **Risk Analysis:** The ‏<organization name> must assess ‏the likelihood of threats, assess their consequences and use results to determine the overall risk level. The <organization name> ‏must ‏adopt ‏a Quantitative or Qualitative methodology to conduct risk analysis.
 2. **Risk Evaluation**: ‏The ‏<organization name> ‏must ‏evaluate ‏cybersecurity risk against its ‏adopted enterprise risk evaluation criteria in the ‏<organization name>  to prioritize such risks. ‏
 2. **Risk Response:**
 1. The <organization name> ‏ ‏must ‏ ‏ ‏select ‏ ‏the ‏ ‏risk response decision based on the following:
 1. **Risk Mitigation**: Mitigate or reduce risk degree by applying the necessary security controls to reduce the likelihood or impact or both, which help control risks and bring them to a level that could be accepted. The organization must do the following:
* Identifying, documenting and prioritizing risk response plans to deal with current risks.
* Executing risk response plans based on priority.
* Calculating residual risks after conducting risk response plans.
 + - 1. ‏**Risk Avoidance**: Remove ‏risk by avoiding the conditions that create it.
 1. Risk Transfer: Pass the risk to a third party that has better capabilities to deal with it or insure information and technology assets against cybersecurity risks.
 2. Risk Acceptance: Risk level is acceptable but in ‏<organization name> continuous monitoring is required in case of any change.
 1. Risk treatment options must be selected and documented based on the outcomes of risk assessment, cost of implementation and expected benefits.
 1. **Risk Oversight:**
 1. To oversee risks, ‏<‏organization name> must develop and maintain a risk register ‏to document outcomes of risk management process. This must include at a minimum the following information:
 1. Risk identifier.
 2. Scope of risks.
 3. ‏Risk Owner.
 4. Description of risks including their causes and impacts.
 5. Risk analysis highlighting risk consequences and their timescale.
 6. Risk evaluation and rating covering risk likelihood and magnitude and overall risk rating if the risk occurs.
 7. Risk treatment plan covering risk treatment action, owner, timeline.
 8. Residual risk description.
 2. ‏ Cybersecurity risk register must be created for operations, cloud computing services, and critical systems and periodically oversee it in alignment with the risk profile. ‏
 3. ‏Cybersecurity ‏risks related to telework systems, services and systems allowed to work remotely, social media accounts, and the services and systems used must be included in the organization cybersecurity risk register and oversee them at least once a year. ‏

 4. If a residual risk does not match the criteria of risk appetite, ‏further controls to reduce risks to an acceptable level must be applied.
2. **Cybersecurity risks in OT/ICS‏**
 1. ‏ OT/ICS cybersecurity risk methodology must be developed as part of risk management methodology and safety risk management and procedures adopted in <organization name>.
