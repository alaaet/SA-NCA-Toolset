Ensure that such reporting relationship of the <cybersecurity function> differs from that of the <information technology function> or <digital transformation function>, as per the Royal Decree No. 37140 dated 14/08/1438H, which is a regulatory requirement under Control No. 1-2-1 in the Essential Cybersecurity Controls (ECC–1:2018).
4. Avoid conflicts of interests, among which:
 1. Managing technology and information system access (or operational systems) validity and their operations at the same time.
 2. Implementing cybersecurity requirements and ensuring compliance with them at the same time.
 3. Conflicts of interests between the cybersecurity monitoring team and the cybersecurity operations team.
 4. Conflicts of interests between the security testing team and the application development team.
5. Ensure that the cybersecurity organizational structure includes the following roles as a minimum:
 1. Cybersecurity governance.
 2. Cybersecurity compliance management.
 3. Cybersecurity risk management.
 4. Cybersecurity strategy management.
 5. Cybersecurity resilience.
 6. Cybersecurity training and awareness.
 7. Cybersecurity operations (Cybersecurity monitoring and incident response).
 8. Data and information protection.
 9. Cybersecurity related to operational systems and industrial control systems (OT/ICS) (if applicable)
6. The following roles might be added to the cybersecurity organizational structure:
 1. Cybersecurity architecture.
 2. Identity and access management.
