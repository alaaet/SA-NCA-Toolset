# [Purpose](#_heading=h.1fob9te)

This policy aims to define cybersecurity requirements related to <organization name>’s Secure Systems Development Life Cycle (SSDLC) process. The policy intends to set the appropriate requirements to govern <organization name>’s systems and software development process in order to reduce the likelihood of cybersecurity attacks though poorly implemented designs and functionality. Integrating SSDLC good practices with <organization name>’s Information Technology (IT) project and change management processes will help reduce the number, to mitigate the impact and to address the root cause of vulnerabilities in system designs, configurations and software packages.

The requirements in this policy are aligned with the cybersecurity requirements issued by the National Cybersecurity Authority (NCA) including but not limited to ECC-1:2018 and CSCC-1:2019, in addition to other related cybersecurity legal and regulatory requirements.

# [Scope](#_heading=h.3znysh7)
