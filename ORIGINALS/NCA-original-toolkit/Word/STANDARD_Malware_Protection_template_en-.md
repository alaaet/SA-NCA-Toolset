| Objective | To ensure the protection of <organization name>’s information system and processing facilities including workstations and infrastructure by implementing protection solutions. |
| Risk Implication | The lack of protection mechanisms and techniques is a main cause for violating the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data, applications, and operating systems because of different malware infecting <organization name>'s information processing facilities. |
| Requirements | |
|  | Malware protection solutions must have the following capabilities:   * Malware Prevention * Malware Detection |
|  | Malware protection solutions must have the capabilities to protect against different varieties of malware including but not limited to:   * Viruses * Worms * Trojan Horses * Spyware * Zero-Day malware * Ransomware * Keylogger |
|  | Malware protection solutions must be configured to protect the end-points of <organization name>’s information and technology assets, including:   * Firewalls * Email servers * Web servers * Proxy servers * Remote-access servers * Workstations * Mobile devices * DNS * DHCP |
|  | Each protection solution must have a central console. This will ensure a consistent implementation of Malware Protection Policy across all end-points, and continuous monitoring of malware threat. |
|  | Malware protection must be comprised of one or multiple tools that provide the functions of:   * Antivirus Software * Intrusion Prevention System * Firewalls * Content Filtering/Scanning * Application Whitelisting * Sandboxing * EDR * Network Intrusion Prevention System (NIPS) and Host Intrusion Prevention System (HIPS) * Host Intrusion Detection System (HIDS)   The functions of protection solutions must be determined based on the outcomes of the risk assessment process. |
|  | Malware detection and prevention events must be sent to the central protection solution and to the central event and log management solution for analysis, correlation, decision-making and application of automation as much as possible. |
|  | Malware defensive mechanisms must be also implemented to reduce the impact of malware threats should they occur. Those mechanisms include:   * BIOS protection. * Application sandboxing. * Browser segregation for corporate and non-corporate applications. * Segregation through virtualization. * Restriction of the automatic activation of a downloaded file, shareware, or freeware. * Restriction of end-user’s privileges on the device they use (without administrative rights). * Restriction of the automatic activation or use of macro files. * Denial of booting systems from diskettes or CDs except in case of an emergency and when using verified media. * Configuration of all software to warn the user in case documents with macros are opened. * Disabling of workstation-workstation communication. |
|  | Uninstallation of a protection solution’s agent must be password protected and remotely managed to ensure that end-users are unable to uninstall the agent, change its settings, or deactivate it and enable alert and logging. |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | Malware Protection Solution Configuration |
| Objective | To ensure the proper configuration is applied to protection mechanisms and techniques for effective protection against malware threats. |
| Risk Implication | Inadequate configuration of protection solutions will result in undetected malware spreading into the <organization name>’s environment and therefore reduced overall effectiveness of the solutions. |
| Requirements | |
|  | The malware protection solution's agent must be configured to perform a real-time scan on all files when they are accessed, copied, or transferred and executed. This will ensure the detection of all malwares before activation. |
|  | The malware protection solution's agent must be configured to perform a full system scan at least once a week. The time of scanning can be either when the system boots up or during non-peak usage hours. |
|  | Malware scanning must be enabled for removable media automatically when these media are inserted or connected. |
|  | Devices must be configured to not auto-run, execute, or download. |
|  | DNS query alerting and logging must be enabled to detect queries for known malicious DNS domains. |
|  | Operating system anti-exploitation and alerting and logging features must be enabled to detect and/or prevent suspicious and malicious activities. |
|  | The malware protection solution must be configured to firstly detect then respond to the malware in dedicated environment as follows: disinfect, delete, quarantine, or encrypt malware upon detection. |
|  | The malware protection solution's agent must be configured to quarantine virus-infected files if they cannot be cleaned. |
|  | The malware protection solution’s agent must be configured to notify the user if it is unable to clean or quarantine the malicious code detected on the machine. |
|  | Malware protection solutions must be installed on email servers including SMTP gateway. Protection solutions must be configured to scan email content and attachments in all emails. If malware is found in an incoming SMTP mail, then the following actions must be taken:   * Infected attachments must be cleaned. * Infected attachments must be quarantined if cleaning them is not possible. * Follow incident response procedures |
|  | Operating system and applications on the protection solution’s central console must be configured as per the relevant vendor's secure configuration guidelines. |
|  | Access to websites and other resources on the Internet known to host malicious content must be prevented using a web content filtering mechanism. |
|  | <organization name> must carry out performance monitoring for the following:   * CPU Utilization * Memory Utilization * Network Performance * Disk Utilization |
|  | Malware protection solutions' administrators must submit periodic reports on a monthly basis on the status of malware protection to <organization name>’s <cybersecurity department>. The report must include the following at a minimum:   * Number of PCs, servers, laptops, and systems not updated with the latest signature patterns. * Top 10 detected malware. * Number of viruses/worms/malicious programs detected. * Number of viruses/worms/malicious programs cleaned/quarantined/deleted. * Action taken to resolve the malware infection. * Source of infection. |
