* An awareness program plan for implementing that strategy has been completed.
* Awareness material has been developed.
* Financial requirements must also be addressed.

1. **Communicating the Plan**

The program implementation must be fully explained to the <organization name>’s senior management to achieve support for its implementation and commitment of necessary resources. This is the explanation of the management and staff roles and responsibilities, as well as expected results of the program and benefits to <organization name>.

1. **Delivering Awareness Material**

Techniques for effectively delivering awareness material should take advantage of technology that supports the following features:

* Ease of use (e.g., easy to access and easy to update/maintain);
* Scalability (e.g., can be used for various audience sizes and in various locations);
* Accountability (e.g., capture and use statistics on degree of completion); and

Some of the more common techniques that the can be employed include:

* Interactive video training (IVT)
* Web-based training
* Non-web, computer-based
* Onsite, instructor-led awareness sessions
* Posters and Brochures
* Screen Savers and Desktop background

Blending various awareness delivery techniques in one session can be an effective way to present material and hold an audience’s attention.

Post Implementation

The <cybersecurity function> of <organization name> must incorporate mechanisms into the cybersecurity strategy to ensure the cybersecurity awareness program continues to be relevant and compliant with overall objectives. Therefore, the program must pay attention to technology advancements, IT infrastructure and organizational changes, and shifts in organizational mission and priorities. Continuous improvement is essential to the success of the cybersecurity awareness program.

1. **Evaluation and Feedback**

Formal evaluation and feedback mechanisms are critical components of any security awareness, training, and education program. Continuous improvement cannot occur without a good sense of how the existing program is working. In addition, the feedback mechanism must be designed to address objectives initially established for the program.

An evaluation assessment needs to be carried out, to identify the cybersecurity awareness and training related maturity level of <organization name>. For this purpose, <organization name> might use the example Cybersecurity Awareness Assessment Questionnaire (Annex A of this document).

A feedback strategy needs to incorporate elements that will address:

* Quality
* Scope
* Deployment method (e.g., web-based, onsite, offsite)
* Level of difficulty
* Ease of use, duration of session
* Relevancy
* Suggestions for modification

<organization name> must also do periodic testing to validate the effectiveness of the cybersecurity awareness program (i.e. simulated attacks, phishing campaign, etc.)

1. **Program Success Factors**

It is critical that everyone is capable and willing to carry out their assigned cybersecurity roles in <organization name>. Listed below are some key indicators to gauge the support for, and acceptance of, the program.

* Sufficient funding to implement the agreed-upon strategy.
* Clearly defined roles and responsibilities to effectively implement the strategy.
