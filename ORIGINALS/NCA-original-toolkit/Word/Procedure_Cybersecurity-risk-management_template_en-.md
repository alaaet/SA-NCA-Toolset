|  | Cybersecurity risk identification | Cybersecurity risks to <organization name>’s business, assets or personnel have to be identified. The purpose of cybersecurity risk identification is to find, recognize and describe cybersecurity risks that might help or prevent an organization achieving its objectives.  All events and circumstances that could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information and technology assets have to be identified. In particular, this will involve identification of the information and technology assets, potential threats to those assets, relevant vulnerabilities and existing controls and then identifying the consequences of loss of confidentiality, integrity and availability of those assets.  Cybersecurity risks, whether or not their sources are under the control of risk owners but in their area of interests, have to be identified. Consideration has to be given that there may be more than one type of outcome, which may result in a variety of tangible or intangible consequences. | Cybersecurity Function | Information on <organization name>’s business, assets and personnel | Identified cybersecurity risks | Cybersecurity Function |
|  | Incorporation of business needs and various cybersecurity risk identification factors | During the cybersecurity risk identification process the following factors have to be considered:   1.

Indicators of emerging cybersecurity risks. 7. The nature and value of assets and resources. 8. Consequences and their impact on objectives. 9. Limitations of knowledge and reliability of information. 10. Time-related factors. 11. Biases, assumptions and beliefs of those involved. | Cybersecurity Function | Identified cybersecurity risks, Business needs | Adjusted list of cybersecurity risks | Cybersecurity Function |
