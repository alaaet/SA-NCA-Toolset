 Cybersecurity Guidelines for E-commerce Service Providers

Executive Summary

E-commerce is considered one of the national transformation program’s goals, that support the
achievement of the kingdom’s vision 2030. Saudi Arabia’s e-commerce spending is estimated to be
SAR 26.8 billion in 20191, making the country one of the largest e-commerce markets in the Middle
East and North Africa (MENA) region. Given the rapid growth of e-commerce in the Kingdom,
and considering the increased threat landscape on e-commerce, the E-commerce Law was approved
by the Council of Ministers, which aims at enhancing the reliability of e-commerce in the Kingdom,
in addition to increasing e-commerce’s contribution to the national economy, and motivating and
improving e-commerce activities in the Kingdom.

The National Cybersecurity Authority (NCA) developed the Cybersecurity Guidelines for
E-commerce Service Providers (CGESP – 1: 2019) to educate and assist Small and Medium
Enterprises (SMEs) and Small Office / Home Office (SoHo) e-commerce service providers within the
Kingdom on implementing best practices to secure their business, devices, data, customer accounts
and payments processes while providing a smooth online shopping experience for consumers.

The main guidelines categories within the CGESP are:
1. Use Strong Authentication
2. Protect Your E-commerce Systems
3. Minimize Impact of Data Breaches
4. Guard Your Social Media Accounts Used in E-commerce
5. Defend Your Network
6. Continuously Educate and Train Your Employees
7. Strengthen Your Internal E-commerce Infrastructure

Introduction

The National Cybersecurity Authority (referred to in this document as “NCA”) developed the
Cybersecurity Guidelines for E-commerce Service Providers (CGESP – 1: 2019) after conducting a
comprehensive study of multiple national and international cybersecurity e-commerce guidelines,
studying related national initiatives, statistics and regulatory requirements; reviewing and
leveraging cybersecurity best practices and analysing previous cybersecurity incidents and attacks
on e-commerce service providers.

In the Kingdom, 26% of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) use social media2 to promote their
products. Around 86% of the SMEs selling online say they have been active as online sellers for
the last three to five years. Most of these e-commerce service providers focus on the Saudi Arabian
market, while a few also target the wider GCC and Middle East markets. On the other hand, almost
all Small Office / Home Office (SoHo) e-commerce service providers (sometimes also referred to as
Online Seller, C2C, Consumer-to-Consumer, Micro Enterprises, or Sole Proprietorships) generate
sales by leveraging social media platforms to reach customers and boost traffic.

The massive increase in the uptake of e-commerce has led to a new generation of associated
cybersecurity threats. Some threats are accidental while others are done deliberately by hackers or
criminals (collectively referred to as attackers in this document). Common security threats include
e-commerce system and data compromise, denial of service and click fraud. Such threats can lead to
decrease in revenue, loss of inventory, IT systems or website being unavailable, this leads to negative
reputation and other legal consequences.

These guidelines are designed to help SME and SoHo e-commerce service providers in the Kingdom
to better understand the e-commerce cybersecurity risks they face and provide them with practical
advice on how to better protect their businesses, systems and data from cyber threats.

 Cybersecurity Guidelines for E-commerce Service Providers

Scope of Applicability

These guidelines are applicable to e-commerce service providers in Saudi Arabia who fall into the
following two segments3:
• SME (Small and Medium Enterprises).
• SoHo (Small Office / Home Office).

The guidelines cover conducting e-commerce using any channel (e.g., social media, websites and
apps) using any computing device (e.g., personal computers, tablets, smart phones and TVs).

These guidelines are for awareness purposes. However, the NCA strongly encourages every e-commerce
service provider in the Kingdom to use these guidelines to implement best practices to minimize
cybersecurity risks to their businesses, systems and data. Furthermore, due to the ever-changing nature
of cyber threats, e-commerce service providers are encouraged to do their own research to see if
additional cybersecurity measures are required.

Relationship to Other National Cybersecurity Publications

In addition to the CGESP, the NCA has also developed the Cybersecurity Guidelines for
E-commerce Consumers (CGEC – 1: 2019) which is intended for educating e-commerce consumers
in the Kingdom. Large enterprises (another segment of e-commerce service providers) should refer
to NCA’s Essential Cybersecurity Controls (ECC – 1: 2018) for guidance and in some cases for
mandatory compliance.

The CGESP complements other related national laws, regulations, frameworks and standards
overseen by the following organizations:
• Ministry of Commerce and Investment (e.g., E-Commerce Act).
• National Cybersecurity Authority (e.g., Data Protection Act – under development).
• Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority “SAMA” (e.g., Cyber Security Framework, Banking
Consumer Protection Principles and other related cybersecurity publications by SAMA).

1. Use Strong Authentication

Scope of
Applicability

1-1

Avoid using predictable, shared or old passwords

In order to protect your e-commerce accounts as a service provider, use
strong passwords that are:
• Made up of random sequence of letters (both upper case and lower

case), numbers, and special characters (!@#$%^&*).

• Not common words, simple sequence of numbers (e.g., “123456”) or any
personal information, such as your birthday or child’s name, as these are
easy to guess.

• Long (at least 8 characters long), which makes it harder for attackers to

break it.

Make sure to change passwords at least every 3 months and never disclose
passwords to others.
Change all default passwords

Some systems and devices come with default admin passwords. Change
these immediately upon installation and before use. Default passwords are
known by attackers and can be used to attack and access your e-commerce
systems. Use a different password for each one of your e-commerce systems,
applications and accounts.
Consider using multi-factor authentication
For systems or applications that handle consumer login, consider deploying
a multi-factor authentication feature to protect your consumers’ accounts.
For example, when a consumer logs in with a password, they may be sent
a code (via text message on their registered mobile phone) which they
have to enter to complete the login process. Also, consider protecting your
own e-commerce account by signing up for additional authentication
mechanisms (such as email messages) offered by e-commerce apps or
websites (including social media accounts).

2. Protect Your E-commerce Systems

Scope of
Applicability

2-1

Know your e-commerce technology assets

2-2

Keep an up to date list of all the current IT equipment, software, data
and any other technology assets you use for e-commerce. The first step in
protecting your e-commerce systems is knowing what devices and data are
critical to your business. Usually, these are the assets that your e-commerce
business cannot function without.
Control number of admin accounts
Grant your e-commerce business employees the lowest level of user rights
required to perform their job duties. An admin account is a high privilege
user account that has more power to make changes in the system than
other user accounts. Admin privileges may be given very carefully, and
every access to the admin account should be strictly controlled through a
more stringent password/multi-factor authentication and a shorter timeout
period. You should also review users’ access periodically and limit the
number of users who have remote access to your systems.

2-3

Use anti-malware software

To protect your e-commerce systems from malware (e.g., viruses), use and
regularly update anti-malware software on every device in your e-commerce
business ecosystem (including computers, smart phones, and tablets). It is
recommended to set the anti-malware software to automatically check for
updates at least daily, and set to run a complete scan on a regular basis.

2-4

Regularly update your applications on all devices
Keep all your e-commerce devices and applications (especially operating
systems) up to date with security patches and vendor upgrades.This is one of
the most effective ways to protect against malware and viruses.

2-5

Stay up to date with cybersecurity threats

Subscribe to vendor notifications and cybersecurity alerts to keep up to
date on cybersecurity trends and active threats. You may also follow latest
updates from trusted organizations (e.g., Computer Emergency Response
Team for cybersecurity – Saudi Arabia (CERT-SA)) to learn more about
cybersecurity trends and publications.

Avoid connecting to non-secure wi-fi networks

Avoid using non-secure networks (e.g., public Wi-Fi) for any business
transaction. These networks are an ideal location for attackers to intercept
data transmission and obtain your data such as login details and financial
information.
Use encryption on your website

Consider using an encryption protocol to secure your e-commerce website.
Such protocols are a good way of ensuring that transactions conducted on
your e-commerce website are secure. This is done by encrypting any data
that gets inputted to your website.

Use trusted websites to display your ads
Protect against fraudulent clicks on your ads by running your ads on trusted
websites which you know are more likely to have actual customers.

3. Minimize Impact of Data Breaches

Scope of
Applicability

3-1

Back up your data

Consider backing up your critical data, which may include your business,
social media and customer information. You can use external online backup
services (e.g., cloud backup) or external storage media (e.g., external hard
drive). If you choose to use a cloud service for backup, refrain from storing
your Saudi customers’ data in the cloud if that provider operates outside
the Kingdom, in order to comply with related and applicable national
cybersecurity and data protection laws and regulations. Furthermore,
perform backups regularly, at least on a weekly basis and check backup tools
effectiveness by validating data on these backups to avoid data loss.

3-2

Protect your data with encryption

Encrypt all the critical data stored on your computer, cloud or external
drive, and data sent over email. Encrypt sensitive files on portable storage
(e.g., USB flash drive) so that data cannot be accessed by others in case you
lost the portable storage.

3-3

Protect customers’ financial data

Follow data minimization principles to reduce the amount and type of
consumers’ data you collect and keep. If you choose to store your customer’s
payment data (e.g., credit card details) on your e-commerce platform, make
sure to apply strict cybersecurity controls (e.g., limited access, encryption)
on such data to protect your business against a payment data breach.
Also make sure to comply with any relevant national or international
cybersecurity laws and regulations. For example, if you have customers
outside Saudi Arabia, make sure to learn about any relevant mandatory
requirements that your business must comply with (e.g., GDPR for EU
customers). Make sure you report to SAMA and your customers any data
breaches affecting your customers’ payment data.

Change your default security settings
Review and change the default preferences in your web browser and
e-commerce apps to avoid saving social media login credentials, customer
information and autofill retrieval. If you do online banking for your business,
consider having a dedicated device which is used only for online banking and
make sure to disconnect it from the network when it is not in use.

Enable remote wiping on your mobile devices
Mobile devices normally come with a feature for remotely wiping all content
in case the user lost his/her device. Activate that feature and ask employees
to promptly report any missing business mobile device as soon as possible
so that the device can be recovered, locked out or remotely wiped. This will
prevent attackers from accessing your e-commerce systems and accounts.

4. Guard Your Social Media Accounts Used in
E-commerce
Exercise safe behavior on social media

Scope of
Applicability

Take extra care while using social networking apps and websites. When
communicating through social media, be suspicious of any messages that
ask for sensitive business information. Social networking sites are becoming
an increasingly popular way for attackers to try to get your business
information. Assign someone to be mainly responsible for your e-commerce
social media accounts.
Get your social media accounts verified
Consider getting your social media account verified. Most social media
platforms offer a visible indication (e.g., icon next to profile username) to
show that this account is verified. Getting verified is a way to increase the
customers’ confidence in this account. Online review platforms (such as
Ma’aroof 4 ) are a good way to get verified as well. Be careful of connection
requests from other businesses you do not know. You may do a quick
online search of the entity to make sure they are legitimate. Avoid linking
your social media account to unknown services or apps, and revoke any
unnecessary access.

5. Defend Your Network

5-1

Disable unnecessary services on systems

Scope of
Applicability

Many devices such as computers and wireless routers come with extra
services and features which are often not used. Similarly, many operating
systems and apps have extra and unnecessary services and software
programs pre-installed. Disable or turn off these features and services.

5-2

Segment and segregate networks
Divide your network into sub-networks to protect sensitive information
from flowing within the non-secure parts of your e-commerce network.

5-3

Defend network perimeter

Use Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) in order to defend your network
perimeter. These systems can detect unusual data traffic patterns or
anomalies in network activities which may indicate that someone is trying
to attack your systems. Another recommended way to defend your network
is to implement a firewall in your network. Make sure to review the access
list periodically.
Test your systems regularly

Conduct penetration tests on your e-commerce systems regularly and
anytime you have a major code change or a system upgrade. Penetration
testing simulates a cyber-attack such as a DDoS to identify weaknesses in
the tested system.

5-4

6. Continuously Educate and Train Your Employees

Scope of
Applicability

6-1

Develop and implement cybersecurity and privacy policies

Develop and implement a cybersecurity policy that defines what employees
can and cannot do when using business systems. The policy should
highlight the consequences that employees will face in case of violating this
policy. Consider training your employees periodically on the cybersecurity
requirements highlighted in your cybersecurity policy. Also, consider
developing a privacy policy that is based on internationally accepted privacy

principles. Make sure to publish a privacy notice that refers to this policy on
your e-commerce store to communicate to consumers your commitment to
protecting their privacy and their personal data.

Protect against phishing and social engineering
Educate your employees and protect against phishing and social
engineering. Social engineering refers to psychological manipulation of
people into revealing confidential personal and financial information.
Attackers usually use phishing emails to conduct social engineering attacks
and gather the information they need to commit fraud or gain access to
business computer systems or social media accounts. You should educate
your employees on the common signs of phishing emails that include, for
example:
• Poor spelling, grammar and punctuation.
Instead of addressing a specific person, they refer to ‘friend’ or ‘valued
colleague’.

• Sense of urgency, in terms of time or request from a senior person in the

company.

• May offer a great discount on a popular item.
Restrict staff from downloading unknown applications
Unknown applications are one of the most likely sources of malware.
Train employees to only use software that is necessary for business and
to download that from trusted sources (e.g., app stores, vendor’s official
website).

Recognize signs of compromise and how to handle incidents
Train employees to handle incidents and recognize signs of compromise.
Also train employees on reporting cybersecurity incidents immediately.
Typical signs may include:
• Computer, applications or network will respond very slowly to

commands and requests.

• Locked out of key accounts and receiving messages that your password

has been changed when you did not change it.
• Unable to access your files, applications or services.

Utilize fraud prevention software
Utilize an e-commerce anti-fraud software solution as this is considered a
good way to stop attacks such as click fraud, mass registration and inventory
abuse. Several vendors offer solutions that combine a click fraud or mass
registration detection algorithm with a blacklist of known fraudulent IP
addresses.
Choose a secure e-commerce platform

When looking for the right e-commerce website or business payments
platform, choose trusted and reputable companies that have good reviews
and are transparent about their privacy policy. Look for international
vendors which comply with ISO or PCI standards or local vendors
who adhere to cybersecurity standards issued by local regulators (e.g.,
NCA, SAMA). Similarly, secure payment gateways come with security
features such as payment authentication systems (e.g., Verified by Visa)
and fraud profiling services, which can check IP addresses, names and
previous purchases, to understand if a purchase is legitimate. You should
also proactively review the breach notification requirements and liability
protections provided with the payment gateway in case of cyberattacks.

Create a customized user registration
If you are going to allow users to register on your website, create a
customized form and link. Malicious bots (a software application that
runs automated tasks over the Internet) are generally programmed to go
looking for default links or input parameters to register fake users. Many
e-commerce platforms offer customization feature to avoid being detected
by bots.
Protect against denial of inventory
Denial of inventory is a serious problem in which bots can hold items from
a limited inventory, but never actually purchase them, thus denying the
goods to other legitimate consumers. Reduce the threat of denial of
inventory by, for example, applying shopping cart policies, where you limit
the absolute time during which users can hold items or restricting the
amount of times they can add the item back to cart.
