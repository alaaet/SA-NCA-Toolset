Executive Summary

E-commerce is considered one of the national transformation program’s goals, that support the
achievement of the kingdom’s vision 2030. Saudi Arabia is one of the largest e-commerce markets in
the Middle East and North African region. Given the rapid growth of e-commerce in the Kingdom,
and considering the increased threat landscape on consumers, the E-commerce Law was approved
by the Council of Ministers, which aims at enhancing the reliability of e-commerce in the Kingdom,
in addition to increasing e-commerce’s contribution to the national economy, and motivating and
improving e-commerce activities in the Kingdom.

The National Cybersecurity Authority (NCA) developed the Cybersecurity Guidelines for
E-Commerce Consumers (CGEC - 1: 2019) to assist consumers within the Kingdom around best
practices to secure their devices, systems, online accounts, data and payments during their online
e-commerce channels.

The main guidelines categories within the CGEC are:
1. Protect Your E-commerce Accounts and Devices
2. Secure Your E-commerce Transactions
3. Exercise Caution When Communicating Online for E-commerce
4. Limit Sharing Your Personal Information

Detailed guidelines are highlighted within this document for each one of the categories above.

Introduction

The National Cybersecurity Authority (referred to in this document as “NCA”) developed the
Cybersecurity Guidelines for E-commerce Consumers (CGEC - 1: 2019) after conducting a
comprehensive study of multiple national and international cybersecurity e-commerce guidelines,
studying related national initiatives, statistics and regulatory requirements; reviewing and
leveraging cybersecurity best practices and analysing previous cybersecurity incidents and attacks
on consumers.

According to a recent study1 of the market in Saudi Arabia, around 58% of the population in the
Kingdom has shopped online at least once every three months, spending an average of SAR 4,000
on online shopping annually. Given the increased use of mobile solutions , such as mobile apps, and
the growing convenience of online shopping, these numbers are likely to be higher. According to
the same study, a significant number of the Saudi population have made purchases from companies
based in other GCC countries and outside the region, while only a fraction of consumers (7%) have
purchased exclusively from Saudi-based e-commerce service providers.

The main drivers of the rapid growth and adoption of e-commerce are the convenience of home
deliveries, the timesaving benefits of e-commerce, the attractive Internet offers, and the wide range
of products from which to choose. However, this has created new types of threats which these
guidelines are trying to address.

Scope of Applicability

These guidelines target all consumers in Saudi Arabia who are conducting e-commerce through any
channel (e.g., social media, websites, apps) using any computing device (e.g., personal computers,
tablets, smart phones and TVs).

These guidelines are for awareness purposes and are intended to help consumers navigate a secure
e-commerce experience.

 Cybersecurity Guidelines for E-commerce Consumers

1. Protect Your E-commerce Accounts and Devices

1-1 USE ANTI-VIRUS SOFTWARE

• Use anti-virus software on all your devices, especially the ones you often
use for e-commerce. If your device does not have a pre-installed anti-
virus software, it is recommended that you install one before conducting
any e-commerce transaction.

• Make sure you use trusted and official versions of anti-virus software

products.

1-2 USE DIFFERENT PASSWORDS
If you are shopping on multiple apps or websites, use a different
password for each. Similarly, use different passwords for your devices
and social media accounts.

• Also, to protect your digital identity, make sure to change your
passwords periodically and never share your passwords with others.

1-3 CREATE STRONG PASSWORDS

• When creating a password for your e-commerce account, follow these

best practices:
- Avoid using common everyday words (e.g., “password”, “qwerty”),
 personal information (e.g., date of birth, graduation year) or sequential
 numbers (e.g., “123456”).
- Do not write it down.
- Make it as long and complicated as possible, using combination of
 special characters (such as @#$%^&), upper case and lower-case letters
 and random numbers.

1-4 CONSIDER USING ADDITIONAL VERIFICATION OPTIONS
If available, consider using additional verification mechanisms (such
as email messages) offered by e-commerce apps or websites (including
social media accounts).

• Choose to shop online with e-commerce service providers who provide

that extra verification protection option.

1-5 UPDATE APPLICATIONS REGULARLY

• Keep all your applications (including operating system and anti-
virus software) on your devices up to date. This can be done either
automatically (by enabling that feature on your device) or manually (by
dedicating a fixed time of the week/month to run the update).

1-6 BACK UP YOUR DATA

• Back up your data by, for example, copying it to your computer or to
an external hard drive to avoid losing your data in case of your device
(which you use for e-commerce) got infected with viruses.
• Enable the automatic back up feature, if available on your device.

1-7 CHANGE DEFAULT SETTINGS ON YOUR DEVICES AND ACCOUNTS

• Review and change the default security and privacy settings on your
accounts and web browser to, for example, avoid saving social media
login credentials, payment or bank account data.

1-8 PAY ATTENTION TO SECURITY WARNINGS

• Do not ignore security warnings (e.g., alerts of unverified e-commerce
service providers or non-secure websites) that may come up on your
screen.

• Make sure that you read and understand them before taking any

further actions.

2. Secure Your E-commerce Transactions

2-1 REVIEW YOUR TRANSACTIONS PERIODICALLY

• Review your bank (specifically your credit card) statements and
electronic wallets (eWallets) transactions periodically. Call your
bank right away if you see any suspicious fraudulent purchases. Stop
your credit card immediately, through, for example, your bank’s app
or website, when your card is stolen. The sooner an online fraud is
detected, the faster other consumers can also be alerted by the bank.

• Make sure your contact information with your bank is up to date.
• Enable SMS notifications on your credit card/eWallet to stay informed

about any transactions on your account.

2-2 USE A DEDICATED CREDIT CARD
If you own multiple credit cards, try to use a dedicated one for
e-commerce purchases.
If offered by your bank, use a low limit card or a pre-paid one.

2-3 SECURE YOUR ELECTRONIC WALLET

• Make sure to protect access to your eWallet with a strong authentication
mechanism (e.g., password). eWallets are becoming more popular and
widely used by consumers, therefore attacks related to these payment
methods are rising.

• Frequently check your eWallet account for suspicious activities (e.g.,

failed login attempts).

3. Exercise Caution When Communicating Online for E-commerce

3-1 PROTECT YOUR ACCOUNT AGAINST UNWANTED MESSAGES
(SPAM)

• Activate the spam filter on your email. Many email services (especially

web email) have a filter included.

• Report spam messages (email/social media) immediately to your email

provider/social media platform.

• Dedicate an email account to be used for e-commerce.

3-2 BE AWARE OF FRAUDULENT CALLS

• Be aware of fraudulent calls. A common scam is fraudulent calls from
fake e-commerce service providers who normally have fake websites/
social media profiles.

• Make it a strong preference to shop and interact only with verified
e-commerce service providers. Online review platforms (such
as Ma’aroof 2) are a good way to check an e-commerce seller’s
authenticity and reputation.

3-3 USE SECURE WEBSITES

• Before you enter your personal or financial details, make sure that the

website’s URL starts with (https://) instead of (http://).

• Avoid e-commerce service providers who do not offer this enhanced
security, as this security feature means the website is using trusted
encryption protocols to protect your personal and financial information.

3-4 BE AWARE OF SUSPICIOUS URLS

• Avoid clicking on links you see on messages (email, SMS, or social

media) or web (usually in advertisements), as these may redirect you
to fake websites.

• Be aware of fake websites which, for example, offer unrealistic prices

for products.

3-5 SHOP USING SECURE APPS, DEVICES AND NETWORKS

• Be aware of fake apps and websites. Those can be avoided by, for
example, downloading apps from the official app stores.
It is highly recommended to avoid conducting e-commerce transactions
or entering your social media credentials on public devices (e.g.,
business center computers at hotels) or connecting to public Wi-Fi
networks (e.g., airport Wi-Fi).

3-6 REPORT INCIDENTS QUICKLY
If your e-commerce account has been hacked, act fast and inform the
merchant.
If your payment card information has been stolen, contact your bank
immediately.
If your device has been compromised, contact local authorities. The
earlier you report any incident, the more you can limit damages.

4. Limit Sharing Your Personal Information

 4-1 READ THE PRIVACY POLICY
• Shop only with reputable e-commerce service providers who have a
privacy policy posted. Read the policy and make sure it clearly explains
how your data will be used and stored by the seller.

• Avoid e-commerce service providers whose policy includes misuse of
personal data (e.g. giving consumers’ personal information (without
their consent) to advertisement agencies).

4-2 PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

• Do not give more personal information than needed when signing up

for an e-commerce account or shopping online.

• Only share the information that is required to enable the specific
e-commerce transaction and do not choose to save or store your
personal or financial information on the apps or website.

• Avoid sharing your credit card details over non-secure communication

channels such as email or social media messages.

4-3 IGNORE PHISHING MESSAGES

• Avoid phishing messages by checking the sender’s identity carefully
before opening the message. Phishing is a message that appears to be
from a legitimate sender and intends to trick the recipient to reveal
personal information such as username, password or credit card details.

4-4 LIMIT PERMISSIONS GRANTED TO APPS

• Carefully consider whether it makes sense to give mobile apps or
websites permissions to access a variety of data and functions on your
device (e.g., location, camera, address book or microphone).
