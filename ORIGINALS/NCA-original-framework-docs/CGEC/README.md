# Cybersecurity Guidelines for e-Commerce

The National Cybersecurity Authority (NCA) is mandated to develop and issue guidelines related to cybersecurity. Accordingly, in a joint effort with the Saudi e-Commerce Council, two cybersecurity guidelines documents were issued: the cybersecurity guidelines for e-commerce service providers and the cybersecurity guidelines for e-commerce consumers.

The first document provides e-commerce service providers, including Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and Small Office / Home Office (SoHo) sellers, with guidelines to protect their e-commerce data, devices and services. The second document provides guidelines to the consumers of e-commerce to help them get a secure shopping experience and to protect their devices, data and personal information during online transactions.
