1 Introduction

As per the mandate of the National Cybersecurity Authority (NCA) that was issued
by the Royal Order number 6801, dated October 31, 2017, the NCA is mandated to
build the national cybersecurity workforce; to participate in developing education
and training programs; to prepare professional standards and frameworks; and to
develop and run professional assessment tests related to cybersecurity. Therefore,
and due to the importance of developing national high-quality academic programs in
cybersecurity, the NCA has worked on the development of the “Saudi Cybersecurity
Higher Education Framework (SCyber-Edu)” to be a guide that can be used for
developing, evaluating and accrediting cybersecurity higher education programs.
This framework was developed by the NCA in cooperation and coordination with
the Ministry of Education and the Education and Training Evaluation Commission.

This framework contributes to setting the minimum curriculum requirements
of cybersecurity higher education programs to assure their academic quality. The
goal of this framework is to ensure that higher education programs in Saudi Arabia
develop highly qualified cybersecurity professionals who can join and enrich the
national cybersecurity workforce and contribute to the national efforts towards “A
resilient, secure and trusted Saudi cyberspace that enables growth and prosperity”.

SCyber-Edu is designed in alignment with the Unified Saudi Classification for
Educational Levels and Specializations, the National Qualifications Framework
(NQF) and the guidelines of the National Center for Academic Accreditation and
Evaluation.

1.1 Scope

This framework covers the following degree programs in cybersecurity:

1. Intermediate Diploma

2. Bachelor

3. Higher Diploma

4. Master

5. Doctoral

 The framework can be used and applied to cybersecurity degree programs offered

by public and private post-secondary educational institutions in Saudi Arabia.

10

Sharing Notice: WhiteDocument Classification: OpenThe Saudi Cybersecurity Higher Education Framework

As of this first version of the document, the framework covers the general
cybersecurity programs only. With the upcoming versions, the framework will
evolve to cover more specialized cybersecurity programs. Since cybersecurity is a
highly dynamic discipline, the curriculum requirements in this framework will be
reviewed and updated periodically.
1.2 Methodology

Even though the field of cybersecurity is still evolving as compared to other
well-established fields such as computer science, several international frameworks
for cybersecurity education have been recently developed to ensure the quality of
cybersecurity education programs. That include the framework of the National
Centers of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense (CAE-CD) Program1, ABET
Criteria for Accrediting Computing Programs, IEEE/ACM Cybersecurity Curricula
2017 and the framework of the NCSC-certified Higher Education Program2 . These
frameworks have major commonalities. These international frameworks have been
studied to define the methodology for preparing the Saudi Cybersecurity Higher
Education Framework by setting the minimum curriculum requirements for each
degree program in cybersecurity in terms of Program Descriptors (PD), through
which Program Learning Outcomes can be derived, and Knowledge Units (KUs)
that students need to study in the program. As mentioned earlier, the SCyber-
Edu is compatible with the Unified Saudi Classification for Educational Levels and
Specializations, the National Qualifications Framework (NQF) and the guidelines of
the National Center for Academic Accreditation and Evaluation.

The PDs correspond to NQF Level Descriptors which help academic organizations
design the Program Learning Outcomes (PLOs) that comprise a set of knowledge,
skills and values which graduates are expected to obtain upon completion of the
program. The SCyber-Edu is intended to contribute to setting the minimum PDs
that need to be considered in writing the PLOs for each degree program. However,
an educational institution can add additional PLOs to its cybersecurity programs.

The KUs are thematic groupings that encompass multiple related topics; where
the topics cover the required curricular content for each KU. Each KU contains a set
of learning outcomes.

The KU-specific learning outcomes specify the minimum of what students should
know or be able to do after successfully completing the KU. It is important for
educational institutions to take into account the depth, expansion and progression
of these learning outcomes to suit the level of the program; and to include learning

1 The CAE-CD program is an initiative sponsored by the National Security Agency and the Department of
Homeland Security in the United States of America.
2 The NCSC-certified higher education program is developed by the National Cyber Security Center in the
United Kingdom.

Sharing Notice: WhiteDocument Classification: OpenThe Saudi Cybersecurity Higher Education Framework

outcomes related to communication skills and values in the curricula. The SCyber-
Edu sets the minimum core KUs that must be covered by the program and provides
a list of elective KUs. Educational institutions can offer the desired elective KUs that
are relevant to their programs and students can choose from them to complete their
graduation requirements. It is important to note that a KU is not necessarily a credit
course. A KU may be covered by one or more credit courses and a credit course may
cover one or more KUs partially or completely.

For the bachelor’s degree, this framework differentiates between a cybersecurity
major degree program and an IT related major degree program with a cybersecurity
track within the program.

The KUs are derived from the following sources:

1. The National Centers of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense (CAE-CD)

Designation Program Guidance and Knowledge Units 2019.

2. The IEEE/ACM Cybersecurity Curricula 2017.
3. The IEEE/ACM Computer Science Curricula 2013.

The necessary additions and modifications were made to meet the national needs

in this field; and to comply with the relevant frameworks in the Kingdom.

For each degree program, SCyber-Edu sets three types of requirements:

1. Admission Requirements: A list of requirements that need to be met prior to

admitting a student into the program.

2. Core KUs: Mandatory KUs that a student must complete as part of the graduation

requirements.

3. Elective KUs: A list of optional KUs that an educational institution and/or a
student can choose from. A minimum number of these elective KUs must be
completed as part of the graduation requirements.

1.3 Prerequisites and Mathematics Requirements

Some KUs are considered to be prerequisites for other KUs. It is requested that

such dependencies are reflected properly in the program of study.

Furthermore, there is a foundational connection between mathematics and many
cybersecurity areas; and most undergraduate cybersecurity programs require some
foundational mathematics knowledge units. However, the mathematics knowledge
units required for a particular program depend heavily on the nature and focus of that

12

program. Therefore, post-secondary educational institutions offering undergraduate
programs in cybersecurity are requested to include mathematics knowledge units
that are relevant to their programs and that properly meet the prerequisites of the
cybersecurity knowledge units in their programs.

The rest of this document is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the covered
cybersecurity programs along with their targeted PDs and KUs requirements.
