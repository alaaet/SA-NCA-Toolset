Introduction:

The National Cybersecurity Authority (NCA) is mandated to “build the national cybersecurity workforce; to participate in developing education and
training programs; to prepare professional standards and frameworks; and to develop and run professional assessment tests related to cybersecurity”.
Therefore, and due to the importance of developing national high-quality academic programs in cybersecurity, the NCA has worked on the development
of the “Saudi Cybersecurity Higher Education Framework (SCyber-Edu)” in cooperation and coordination with the Ministry of Education and the
Education and Training Evaluation Commission.

The framework was developed by the NCA in cooperation and coordination with the Ministry of Education and the Education and Training Evaluation

Commission.

SCyber-Edu is designed in alignment with the Unified Saudi Classification for Educational Levels and Specializations, the National Qualifications

Framework (NQF) and the guidelines of the National Center for Academic Accreditation and Evaluation.

The framework can be used and applied to cybersecurity degree programs offered by public and private higher educational institutions in Saudi Arabia.
It covers the program descriptors of the cybersecurity higher education degree programs, admission requirements, core knowledge units, and elective
knowledge units, as illustrated in Figure 1.
