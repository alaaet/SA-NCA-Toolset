Traffic Light Protocol (TLP):

This marking protocol is widely used around the world. It has four colors (traffic lights):

Red – Personal, Confidential and for Intended Recipient Only

The recipient has no rights to share information classified in red with any person outside the
defined range of recipients either inside or outside the organization.

Amber – Restricted Sharing

The recipient may share information classified in orange only with intended recipients inside the
organization and with recipients who are required to take action related to the shared information.

Green – Sharing within the Same Community

The recipient may share information classified in green with other recipients inside the organization
or outside it within the same sector or related to the organization. However, it is not allowed to
exchange or publish this information on public channels.

White – No Restriction

1 Introduction

The Saudi National Cybersecurity Authority (NCA) is leading the national effort to protect the
country’s cyber space. This mission requires a qualified national cybersecurity workforce capable of
carrying out all types of cybersecurity work. The NCA’s mandate was issued by Royal Order number
6801, dated October 31, 2017. It includes building the national cybersecurity workforce, participating
in the development of education and training programs, preparing professional standards and
frameworks and developing and running tests to assess cybersecurity professionals. The NCA has
developed the Saudi Cybersecurity Workforce Framework (SCyWF) as a foundational step towards
carrying out that mandate.

1.1 An Overview

The SCyWF categorizes cybersecurity work in Saudi Arabia, defines the job roles within each
category and sets the requirements for each job role in terms of tasks, knowledge, skills and abilities
(TKSAs).

The main objective of the SCyWF is to serve as a reference model and a guideline for preparing,
developing, recruiting, promoting and managing the cybersecurity workforce. It provides a common
lexicon that improves communication and content development for talent management activities. It
also helps in mapping learning outcomes of education and training programs to the knowledge, skills
and abilities (KSAs) required for different cybersecurity job roles.

Organizations are recommended to adopt this framework so they can align their cybersecurity
workforce structures and activities with the national frameworks and guidelines. However, they can
customize the framework to address their requirements.

Since cybersecurity is a highly dynamic discipline, the content of this framework will be reviewed

and updated periodically.

1.2 Methodology and Structure

The SCyWF is developed in alignment with the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education
(NICE) Cybersecurity Workforce Framework from the U.S. National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST)1. The SCyWF uses the methodology of the NICE framework. It organizes
cybersecurity work in a hierarchical structure composed of categories, specialty areas and job roles

doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-181

Sharing Indicator: WhiteDocument Classification: UnclassifiedThe Saudi Cybersecurity Workforce Framework

in line with the NICE approach. However, the SCyWF categories, specialty areas and job roles are
different from those in the NICE framework and have been developed to address the cybersecurity
workforce demand in Saudi Arabia. The job roles, specialty areas and categories are defined as follows.

A job role is a set of cybersecurity tasks that need to be performed in a cybersecurity job. A job role
is defined by a set of tasks to be performed within that job role and a list of KSAs required to perform
those tasks. All SCyWF job roles are listed in Appendix A.

A specialty area is a group of job roles that serve a cybersecurity function and share common TKSAs.

A category is a group of specialty areas and the job roles associated with them, that serve related
cybersecurity functions.

This framework only covers job roles that are specific to cybersecurity. There are non-cybersecurity
job roles that have some cybersecurity responsibilities or require some cybersecurity KSAs. Most of
these non-cybersecurity job roles are IT job roles, and they are outside the scope of this framework. In
addition, all employees and IT users are expected to have some awareness of cybersecurity risks and
good practice.

Figure 1 illustrates the structure of the SCyWF.

2. The Saudi Cybersecurity Workforce Framework Taxonomy

The SCyWF has five cybersecurity work categories, twelve specialty areas and forty job roles. These are
defined in a brief description summarizing the work performed in that specific category, specialty area or
job role. Each job role is associated with a set of tasks to be performed within that job role and a list of KSAs
required to perform those tasks.

A Knowledge is defined as the set of data, facts, information, theories, concepts, issues and trends related to
a particular subject.

A Skill is defined as the capability to apply knowledge and to use tools and methods to carry out a task.

An Ability is defined as the behavior-based competence that is necessary to perform the work in a particular
field.

A Task is defined as a set of activities that need to be completed as part of a particular job role.

The TKSAs for the job roles in the SCyWF have been developed using the long list of TKSAs in the NICE
framework with the necessary changes being made to address the cybersecurity workforce demand in Saudi
Arabia. Appendix B gives a complete list of the SCyWF’s TKSAs.

Figure 2 shows the full SCyWF taxonomy and how categories, specialty areas and job roles relate.

Table 1 describes the SCyWF categories. Each category has a unique identifier (ID) composed of the first
characters of the category’s name (e.g. PD for Protection and Defense). This forms part of the full job role ID
for the job roles under each category as described in Appendix A.

Table 2 describes the SCyWF specialty areas and the categories to which they belong. Each specialty area has a
unique ID composed of the first characters of the specialty area’s name (e.g. VA for Vulnerability Assessment).
This is used alongside the category ID when creating job role IDs for the jobs under each specialty area, as
described in Appendix A.

3.2 Appendix B: List of Tasks, Knowledge, Skills and Abilities

As stated before, the SCyWF is developed using the methodology of the NIST’s NICE framework. However,
the SCyWF categories, specialty areas and job roles are different from those in the NICE framework and have
been developed to address the cybersecurity workforce demand in Saudi Arabia.

Moreover, the TKSAs for the job roles in the SCyWF have been developed using the long list of TKSAs in
the NICE framework with the necessary changes being made to address the cybersecurity workforce demand
in Saudi Arabia.

TKSAs in the SCyWF are numbered as shown in Table 8. Tables 9, 10, 11 and 12 show the descriptions of

tasks, knowledge, skills and abilities, respectively.
