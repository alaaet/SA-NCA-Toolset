Introduction

The Saudi Cybersecurity Workforce Framework (SCyWF) categorizes cybersecurity work in Saudi
Arabia, defines the job roles within each category and sets the requirements for each job role in terms
of tasks, knowledge, skills and abilities (TKSAs).

Organizations are recommended to adopt and use this framework so they can align their cybersecurity
workforce structures and activities with the national frameworks and guidelines. However, they can
customize the framework to address their requirements.

The required cybersecurity job roles are determined according to the organization needs to satisfy its

cybersecurity requirements and that depends on the organization’s size and business nature.

The job roles specified in this framework have been included in the Saudi Standard Classification of

Occupations which was approved by the Cabinet Resolution No. (660), dated 10/24/1441 AH.

What are the Objectives of “SCyWF”?

To serve as a reference model
and a guideline for preparing,
recruiting,
developing,
promoting
and managing
the cybersecurity workforce

To provide a common lexicon
that improves communication
between managers
and
Human Recourses personnel
retaining
for
and
specialized
cybersecurity
talents

attracting,
training
in

learning
in mapping
To help
outcomes of education and training
programs to the knowledge, skills
and abilities (KSAs) required for
different cybersecurity job roles

Why do we need to link all cybersecurity job titles

at the entity to “SCyWF” job roles?

1. To accurately identify the knowledge, skills and abilities required for the various cybersecurity job

roles.

2. To determine the number of qualified employees for each job role at the organization level, at the
sector level and at the national level; and to determine the workforce demand for each job role.

“SCyWF” Framework Alignment Mechanism

Listing the job roles within “SCyWF” framework that exist at the
organization according to the tasks assigned:
• Review cybersecurity job roles in “SCyWF” framework.
• Determine the job roles (from “SCyWF” framework) that represent
the cybersecurity jobs at the organization based on the tasks of
the job roles within “SCyWF” framework and the nature of the
organizations’ cybersecurity work, regardless of the structure of the
cybersecurity department and units in the organization.

Linking the listed job roles to the existing jobs at the organization:
• Examine the organization’s job titles that relate to cybersecurity
tasks and link them to the corresponding job roles within “SCyWF”
framework.

• Update the job titles at the organization according to the
corresponding job roles within “SCyWF” framework based on the
tasks related to the job.

Handling special cases, including:
• When a proper justification exists, two or more job roles within
“SCyWF” framework can be mapped to one job at the organization,
provided that the job title reflects the tasks associated with these
job roles.

• When a proper justification exists, a job role within “SCyWF”
framework can be mapped to two or more cybersecurity jobs at the
organization, provided that the job titles reflect the tasks associated
with them.

• The jobs of the cybersecurity managers at the organization are
related to different specialty areas and job roles within “SCyWF”
framework (e.g., the Incident Response Manager). In these cases,
the administrative position at the organization can be mapped
to two job roles within “SCyWF” framework, one of them is
“Cyberseurity Manager” and the other role depends on the specialty
of the administrative unit associated with the cybersecurity job.

Document the alignment process:

Preparing an internal document to be approved by the organization’s
authority holder. The document should include the mapping between
the identified cybersecurity job roles within “SCyWF” framework and
the existing cybersecurity jobs at the organization. In addition, it should
include the documentation of any special cases that were addressed as
in the previous step.

Examples of mapping job titles in the organization with the relevant
job roles in “SCyWF” framework

Example 1: Linking a job in the organization with one job role in “SCyWF” framework with the
same job title:

What is the relationship between Human Resources Programs
and “SCyWF” Framework?

“SCyWF” framework does not define the organizational structure of the
cybersecurity department and units in the organization, but it can help
in designing the organizational structure of cybersecurity departments
by understanding the tasks of the job roles, categories, and specialty
areas included in the framework. However, there are other cybersecurity
controls and guidelines issued by NCA related to the organizational
structure of cybersecurity departments.

“SCyWF” framework facilitates the process of creating, updating and
standardizing job descriptions in the field of cybersecurity within
national entities as each role has a job description that includes a
description of the tasks, knowledge, skills and abilities required for each
job role.

“SCyWF” framework enables human resources personnel to understand
the tasks and requirements of cybersecurity jobs, hence facilitating the
process of searching and selection of suitable qualified talents.

“SCyWF” framework enables human resource personnel to benefit
from the knowledge, skill and abilities of each job role in the framework
through the process of creating or updating the technical and behavioral
competencies framework of cybersecurity jobs.

“SCyWF” framework assists human resources personnel in preparing
training and development plans based on the knowledge, skills and
abilities required for each job role.

Currently NCA is working on preparing an appendix of “career paths”
for “SCyWF” framework, which clarifies the levels of each job role
in terms of the minimum qualifications, tasks, knowledge and skills
required as a benchmark for career progression, as well as the possible
transfers between job roles and their levels.
