Executive Summary

The mandate and duties of National Cybersecurity Authority (referred to in this document as
“NCA”) fulfill the strategic and regulatory cybersecurity needs related to the development of
national cybersecurity policies, governance mechanisms, frameworks, standards, controls, and
guidelines in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia. These mandates also fulfill the need to continuously
monitor the compliance of organizations to support the important role of cybersecurity, which
has increased with the rise of security risks in cyberspace more than any time before.

The world witnesses a rapid advancement in Industrial Control Systems (ICS), which imposes a
continuous increase in cyber threats towards these systems. This demands the necessity to have
cybersecurity controls tailored for Industrial Control Systems (ICS) in order to increase the
protection of critical infrastructures that operates or depends on these systems with accordance
to international best practices.

From this prospective, Operational Technology Cybersecurity Controls (OTCC-1:2022) is
developed to increase the protection of OT/ICS environment. These controls must be implemented
as an extension to NCA’s Essential Cybersecurity Controls (ECC-1: 2018). However, the term
Industrial Control Systems (ICS) includes all devices, systems, or networks used to operate and/
or automate industrial processes

All applicable organizations must implement all necessary measures to ensure continuous
compliance with these controls as per item 3 of Article 10 of NCA’s mandate and, as per the
Royal Decree number 57231, dated 10/11/1439AH.

Introduction

The National Cybersecurity Authority (NCA) developed Operational Technology Cybersecurity
Controls (OTCC-1:2022) after completing conducting a comprehensive study of multiple
national and international cybersecurity frameworks and standards. In addition to that, NCA has
reviewed and leveraged international OT/ICS cybersecurity guidance, standards, and controls.

The Operational Technology Cybersecurity Controls (OTCC) contains the following:

• 4 Main Domains.

• 23 Subdomains.

• 47 Main Controls.

• 122 Subcontrols.

Objectives

These controls are developed as an extension to the ECC in order to achieve higher levels of national
cybersecurity goals by focusing on Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and defining its cybersecurity
requirements. This enables national organizations to fulfill mandated cybersecurity requirements to
increase the protection of its critical infrastructure and its readiness level towards cybersecurity risks.

OTCC document addresses the below four main cybersecurity pillars:
• Strategy
• People
• Process
• Technology

Scope of Work and Applicability

Scope of Work

These controls are applicable to Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) that reside in facilities that are
deemed critical and owned and/or operated by government organizations (including ministries,
authorities, establishments, and others), as well as private sector organizations owning, operating
or hosting Critical National Infrastructures (CNIs), whether they are in the kingdom or abroad,
which are all referred to herein as “Organization”. Critical facilities are defined as the facilities
where their destruction and/or dysfunction may lead to the disruption or discontinuity of the
organization’s operation. Additionally, the term Industrial Control Systems (ICS) includes all
devices, systems, or networks used to operate and/or automate industrial processes.

NCA strongly encourages all other organizations in the Kingdom to leverage these controls to
implement best practices to improve and enhance their OT cybersecurity.

Statement of Applicability

Every organization within the scope of this document that owns or operates Industrial Control
Systems (ICS) technologies must comply with all applicable controls in this document after
ensuring that applying applicable controls will not jeopardize the continuity of the organization’s
operation.

Document Classification: PublicOperational Technology Cybersecurity ControlsSharing Indicator: White

Implementation and Compliance

To comply with item 3 of article 10 of NCA’s mandate and per the Royal Decree number 57231,
dated 10/11/1439H, all organizations within the scope of these controls must comply with all
applicable cybersecurity controls in accordance with the appropriate control levels.

Compliance with Essential Cybersecurity Controls (ECC 1:2018) is a mandatory prerequisite for
the organization.

NCA evaluates the organization’s compliance with the (OTCC:1-2022) through multiple means
such as self-assessment by the Organization and/or audit field visits by NCA or designated third-
parties in accordance with the mechanisms approved by NCA.

Assessment and Compliance Tool

NCA issues a tool (OTCC:1-2022 Assessment and Compliance Tool) to organize the process of
the evaluation and compliance measurement against the OTCC controls.

Facility Level Identification Tool

NCA issues a tool (OTCC:1-2022 Facility Level Identification Tool) to organize the process of
the assigning the appropriate levels to the critical facility within the scope of this document.

Update and Review

NCA will periodically review and update the OTCC (in addition to any supplement documents
related to the OTCC) as per the cybersecurity requirements and related industry updates. NCA
will communicate and publish the updated version of OTCC for implementation and compliance.

OTCC Methodology and Mapping

NCA developed the OTCC Methodology and Mapping Annex, which is part of the OTCC
document. The OTCC Methodology and Mapping Annex consists of the following:

• Design principles and methodology of the OTCC.
• Relationship between OTCC and ECC Domain 5.
• Relationships to multiple international standards and best practices.
• Methodology of designing OTCC main domains and subdomains.
• Methodology of defining OTCC Controls & Sub-Controls levels.

OTCC Controls & Sub-controls Levels

There are 3 levels defined in the Operational Technology Cybersecurity Controls (OTCC) that
are dependent on the following criteria:
• The criticality, consequences, and impact on the organization’s business and services’ availability.
• The negative impact on Health, Safety, and/or Environment (HSE) of the organization.
• The negative Impact on national economy, national security or social influence.

Table (1) illustrates the 3 OTCC control levels based on the outcome of the facility level identification
tool:

The criticality level of the facility is high and have severe ad-
verse effects, consequences, and/or impacts to operations, cat-
strophic or assets, resources, or Health, Safety, and Environ-
ment (HSE) of the organization.
The criticality level of the facility is moderate and have sig-
nificant effects, consequences, and/or impacts to operations,
assets, resources, or Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE) of
the organization.
The criticality level of the facility is low and have moderate
adverse effects, consequences, and/or impacts to operations,
assets, resources, or Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE) of
the organization.
