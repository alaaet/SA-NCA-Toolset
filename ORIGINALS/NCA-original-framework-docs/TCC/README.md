# Telework Cybersecurity Controls (TCC)

Based on the objectives of the National Cybersecurity Authority (NCA) strategy and in continuation of its role in regulating and protecting the Kingdom's cyberspace, NCA has issued the Telework Cybersecurity Controls (TCC) document. These controls were developed after reviewing many international cybersecurity standards, frameworks, controls and international practices in cybersecurity. The document aims to contribute to raising the level of cybersecurity at the national level by enabling the organization to perform its work remotely in a secure manner and adapt to the changes in the business environment and telework systems, and enhancing the organization’s cybersecurity capabilities and resilience against cyber threats when providing remote work. These controls are an extension to the Essential Cybersecurity Controls (ECC).
