# Organizations’ Social Media Accounts Cybersecurity Controls
Based on the objectives of the National Cybersecurity Authority (NCA) strategy and in continuation of its role in regulating and protecting the Kingdom's cyberspace, NCA has issued the Organizations’ Social Media Accounts Cybersecurity Controls document. These controls were developed after reviewing many international cybersecurity standards, frameworks, controls and international practices in cybersecurity. The document aims to contribute to enhancing the cybersecurity of organizations’ social media accounts to address the risks of crimes of stealing official communication accounts, misuse of them, or impersonation. These controls are an extension to the Essential Cybersecurity Controls (ECC).
