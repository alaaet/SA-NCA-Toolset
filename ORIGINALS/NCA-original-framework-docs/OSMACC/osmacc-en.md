Executive Summary

Social networks are one of the enablers for rapid and effective communication with the beneficiaries,
which contributes to a speedy response and improving and facilitating the experience of the beneficiaries.
With the increase in the use of social networks officially by organizations inside the Kingdom to
communicate with the beneficiaries, the risk of theft crimes of official social media accounts, misuse of
them or impersonation has increased, which necessitates setting cybersecurity requirements to reduce
these risks.

To contribute to reducing these risks and enhancing the protection of organizations’ social media
accounts, with the aim of reaching a safe and reliable Saudi cyber space that enables growth and
prosperity; The National Cybersecurity Authority has developed the Organizations’ Social Media
Accounts Cybersecurity Controls (OSMACC - 1: 2021) to set the minimum cybersecurity requirements
to enable organizations to use social networks in a safe manner. This document explains the details
of the Organizations’ Social Media Accounts Cybersecurity Controls, their goals, scope of work, and
compliance approach and monitoring.

Organizations must implement all necessary measures to ensure continuous compliance with these
controls, in order to comply with item 3 of article 10, in the mandate of the National Cybersecurity
Authority.

Introduction

The National Cybersecurity Authority (referred to in this document as “The Authority”) has developed
the Organizations’ Social Media Accounts Cybersecurity Controls (OSMACC - 1: 2021) after conducting
a study of cybersecurity best practices and analyzing previous cyber incidents and attacks. This comes
within the mandate and tasks of The Authority according to its mandate as per the Royal Decree No.
(6801) dated 11/2/1439 AH, “Establishing policies, governance mechanisms, frameworks, standards,
controls and guidelines related to cybersecurity, circulating them to the relevant organization, following
up on compliance with them, and updating them.”

Social networks are one of the enablers for rapid and effective communication with the beneficiaries,
which contributes to a speedy response and improving and facilitating the experience of the beneficiaries.
With the increase in the use of social networks officially by organizations inside the Kingdom to
communicate with the beneficiaries, the risk of theft crimes of official social media accounts or misuse
of them has increased. In addition, the risk of impersonation of official organizations in social networks.

To contribute to reducing these risks and enhancing the protection of organizations’ social media
accounts, with the aim of reaching a safe and reliable Saudi cyber space that enables growth and
prosperity; The National Cybersecurity Authority has developed the Organizations’ Social Media
Accounts Cybersecurity Controls (OSMACC - 1: 2021) to set the minimum cybersecurity requirements
to enable Organizations’ to use social networks in a safe manner.

In preparing the Organizations’ Social Media Accounts Cybersecurity Controls, The Authority has
been keen to align its components with the components of the Essential Cybersecurity Controls that
are a basic requirement for the OSMACC. Adherence to OSMACC can only be achieved by achieving
continuous compliance with the Essential Cybersecurity Controls in the first place, as they are linked
to relevant national and international legislative and regulatory requirements.

The Organizations’ Social Media Accounts Cybersecurity Controls consist of the following:
3 Main Domains

12 Subdomains

15 Main Controls

 38 Subcontrols

Objectives

The Organizations’ Social Media Accounts Cybersecurity Controls aim to:

• Contribute to raising the level of cybersecurity at the national level.

• Enabling organizations to use social networks in a safe manner.

• Readiness to respond effectively to cyber incidents that may have negative impacts.

 Scope of Work and Applicability

Scope of Work

These controls apply to government organizations in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, including ministries,
authorities, establishments and others, and organizations and companies related to them. It also applies
to private sector organizations that own, operate or host sensitive national infrastructure. All of them
are referred to in this document as (The Organization).

The NCA strongly encourages all other organizations in the Kingdom to leverage these controls to
implement best practices to improve and enhance their cybersecurity.

Statement of Applicability

These controls have been prepared so that they are compatible with the cybersecurity requirements
for all organizations and sectors in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia taking into account the diversity
and nature of work, and The Organization that uses social networks must adhere to all the controls
applicable to it.

Organizations’ Social Media Accounts Cybersecurity ControlsSharing Notice: WhiteDocument Classification: Open

Implementation and Compliance

In order to comply with item 3 of article 10, in the mandate of the National Cybersecurity Authority,
organizations must implement all necessary measures to ensure continuous compliance with these
controls, which cannot be achieved without achieving continuous compliance with the Essential
Cybersecurity Controls (ECC – 1: 2018) where applicable.

The Authority evaluates organizations’ compliance with the OSMACC through multiple means such
as self-assessments by the organizations, and/or on-site audits, in accordance with the mechanisms
deemed appropriate by the Authority.

Update and Review

The Authority will periodically review and update the OSMACC as per the cybersecurity requirements
and the related industry updates. The Authority will communicate and publish the updated version of
OSMACC for implementation and compliance.
